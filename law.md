The Australian government, with the help of the opposition,
are pushing through a bill, blandly called
the [_Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment
(Data Retention) Bill 2015_](http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22legislation/bills/r5375_third-reps/0000%22).
This is a direct attack on your right to
privacy, and means that every communication you participate in is
kept on record for two years. During that time, employees of
certain agencies can access the data without judicial
oversight.

Doesn't that sound <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span>lovely<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span>?

### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-barcode"></span> <a name="what"></a>What is metadata?
Metadata is data about data. Imagine we have the following data:

<div align="center">
    <table class="table table-striped table-hover">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tony</td>
            <td>57</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Joe</td>
            <td>49</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Julie</td>
            <td>58</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Warren</td>
            <td>66</td>
          </tr>
    </table>
</div>

The metadata of this table would say that there are four
people that the table describes. This is a description of the
description; the data of the data. Sounds innocent enough, right?

In communication terms, metadata
is information about the piece of communication being sent, without
including the contents of the communication itself.

Image that, every time you sent a letter, the following was recorded:

- the address it's being sent to,
- the return address,
- the stamp used,
- the weight of the letter,
- the colour of the ink used to mark the envelope,
- the type of envelope.

This captures some of what is covered by capture of communications metadata, except that
some other things might be captured, like

- the physical location where the communication was sent from,
- the location of where the recipient's mail is,
- what application you were using when you sent the data,
- the operating system of the device that you are using.

<p class="lead" align="center">However, there is <strong>no definition of metadata in this law</strong>.</p>

Metadata could, then, conceivably mean __anything__:[^nodef]

>When you browse a webpage the distinction between content and metadata disappears because it's all
machine-produced (and machine-understandable) information about web resources. It's all metadata. Alternatively,
it's all content!

Or, put more forcefully by information security expert Bruce Schneier:[^schneier]

>... Now imagine that you asked that same private detective to put a subject under constant surveillance.
You would get a different report, one that included things like where he went, what he did, who he spoke to -- and for how long -- who he wrote to, what he read, and what he purchased. This is all metadata, data we know the NSA is collecting. So when the president says that it's only metadata, what you should really hear is that we're all under constant and ubiquitous surveillance.

### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-save"></span> <a name="collecting"></a>So... what exactly does the law say they are collecting?
The following are specifically stated in the legislation as being required by law to
be collected:[^collection]

1. The subscriber of, and accounts, services, telecommunications devices and
other relevant services relating to, the relevant service.
1. The source of a communication.
1. The destination of a communication.
1. The date, time and duration of a communication, or of its connection to a relevant service.
1. The type of a communication or of a relevant service used in connection with a communication.
1. The location of equipment, or a line, used in connection with a communication.

### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-list"></span> What can they do with it? <a name="do"></a>

The bill

- __forces__ Internet Service Providers (ISPs, like Telstra, Optus, iiNet, TPG) to
store your metadata for __two years__, and

- allows law enforcement agencies to access the data __without a warrant__ and
without being required to notify __anybody__, only keep records that they
have accessed the data. The
organisations that are specified in the legislation are:[^agencies]

    - (a) the Australian Federal Police;
    - (b) a Police Force of a State;
    - (c) the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity;
    - (d) the ACC (Australian Crime Commission);
    - (e) the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service;
        - (ea) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission;
        - (eb) the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission;
    - (f) the Crime Commission;
    - (g) the Independent Commission Against Corruption;
    - (h) the Police Integrity Commission;
    - (i) the IBAC (Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission);
    - (j) the Crime and Corruption Commission of Queensland;
    - (k) the Corruption and Crime Commission;
    - (l) the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption.

If this list seems long, it is.
__The metadata of every communication you transmit will be easily accessible by 14
different agencies.__

### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span> The Ombudsman<a name="ombudsman"></a>

The bill also mandates that there __must__ be a Commonwealth Ombudsman[^ombudsman], who
is the only real mechanism of oversight in the law.

The Ombudsman has the power to:

- enter any of the premises of the above agencies,
- gain "full and free access at all reasonable times to all records of the agency that are relevant to the inspection",
- request that "a member of staff of the agency to give the Ombudsman any information that the Ombudsman considers necessary, being information:
(i) that is in the member’s possession, or to which the member has access; and (ii) that is relevant to the inspection", regardless
of other laws.

__However, this method of oversight only works if the Ombudsman has independence and integrity.__ All we can do is cross
our fingers and hope.

### <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-flash"></span> Does it work?<a name="work"></a>
It is unclear clear how well metadata retention works in investigation of crime. Australian enforcement agencies
are unable to give clear indications on how effective any such regime might be.[^effectiveness]
The Government [has admitted](http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2015/s4172660.htm) that
retention is easy, and legal, to sidestep.[^sidestep]
